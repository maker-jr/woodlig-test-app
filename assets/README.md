# Profile-Section #
This is an app I created to showcase my skills in **React Native** As requested by **Woodlig Tech**

Below is the instruction from the test for reference: 

## Test Instructions ##

**Test: Create a page Labelled _"Profile-Section"_ using either 'CRNA' or 'EXPO' with the following as guidlines:**

1. A header with an image height of about 3/4 (Three quaters) of the device screen.
2. On scroll, the header image should animate to a height of 50 (Fifty).
3. Below the header their should be **swipe-able Tabs** with content randing from a simple form to a 3x3 media grid.

**NB:** The animated header's content should preferably be in text format.
Your creativity level matters here.

**GOODLUCK**

## Docs ##

The app contains a single screen. I used [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/material-top-tab-navigator.html) for the tabs and the [React Native Animated](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated) Library for the animations.

`ScrollView` for the scrolling behaviour and `Flex` for layout

## Build ##

You'll need Expo to run the app (Was requested from the instructions above).
Clone the repo then `cd WoodligTest` and run `npm install` inside the directory. Next run `npm start`or `expo start` and stream the app from you expo client :D
